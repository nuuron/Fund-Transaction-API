Your task is to build a simple REST API using Spring Boot Framework and PostgreSQL.

## API TASK

Implement a transaction API for enabling fund transfer between users.

## SUBTASK 1: Database Design

- You will use PostgreSQL as your choice of database for this assignment.
- Create sql scripts for database creation. It should be possible to setup the db with a single terminal command.
- Load a `users` table from spec/users.json with a load script. You can use any language for this (python, js, raw sql, shell, etc) but it must be automated.
- The `transactions` table should have valid {senderId, receiverId}. Both these values should belong to a valid users. Bonus points if you use foreign keys!

### SUBTASK 2: Retrieve a transaction

`GET: /api/transactions/<transactionId>`

- Returns transaction information for a given transaction Id. Check `spec/transaction.json` for the transaction format.

### SUBTASK 3: Retrieve all transactions

`GET: /api/transactions/`

- Returns all transactions [list of spec/transaction.json]

### SUBTASK 4: Create a new transaction

`POST: /api/transactions/`

- Creates a new transaction.
- Payload will contain `{senderId, receiverId, amount, details}`.
- Transaction Id will be autogenerated on backend - **should be uuid!**.
- Validate the transaction to check if balance is sufficient in sender's account.
- Store the transaction in the database.

## SUBTASK 5: Reverse a transaction

`DELETE: /api/transactions/<transactionId>`

- Reverses a transaction and restores the senders and receivers balance accordingly.

## Notes

- You will be evaluated on basis of code quality - namely code structure, variable and function names, separation of responsibilities between classes. (Check SOLID principles in references)
- Design your database schemas with appropriate data types and keep in mind that queries should be easy to write.
- Feel free to make any assumptions if you feel we have not mentioned something but make sure you inform us about them during the time of submission.

## Submission

- Create a Github repository for this task and name it - `yourfirstname_neowise_se_assignment`.
- Add [Abhay Nadkarni (anad97)](https://github.com/anad97) as contributor to your github repository so that the assignment can be reviewed.
- Include this README in your repository and add an additional section describing the steps requried to run the code.
- Each change should be submitted in the form of well labelled commits.
- Make sure the PostgreSQL db is in the repository before submitting.
